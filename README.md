# Markov-switching-regime-process-and-EM-algorithm
In this section, I perform the Markov switching regime to AR(1) process with homoskedasticity.
The model is estimated using Maximum Likelihood estimator and EM algorithm to implement optimization
The EM algorithm appears to depend severely on the choice of initial values and does not perform well in this case.
